      <h2>Stuff and Such</h2>
      <p>I’ve been thinking about my ex lately. Maybe it’s the lack of sex. Sex with her was unfairly good. Sometimes I didn’t have to do anything; I just lay there, and she did everything—amazing head, mounting and moving as if we were going to die the next day. I remember the last time we did it. She told me to come and pick up my stuff. She could have done anything with it, but there’s something unspoken in the stuff left behind: you can tell how everything is going to end. She might have said “I got rid of it” or “I’ll send it to you.” Sometimes, the stuff doesn't even survive; it’s lost, forgotten, and not even worth mentioning. Anyhow, she asked me to come and get my stuff. But there were still many things left unsaid, and I had the chance to explain myself. She cried. I wrapped my arms around her, and she rested her head on my chest. You feel vulnerable when you open up about your emotions, like you’re digging through the guts of the past—the memories, the glances, the moments. When the arguing is finally over, there’s a sense of relief, almost like when you’re on solid ground again after drowning in the open sea, but there’s still a void inside. You’ve tasted every bottle in the emotional cellar: sweet, bitter, sour. She softly rubbed my belly. I got hard and placed her hand down there. She grabbed it firmly. I turned her face and kissed her gently on the lips. She kissed me back madly, putting her tongue inside my mouth, almost as if she were claiming something. I pulled her hair back and licked her neck. She pushed me back, lay down on the couch, and slid off her jeans. I immediately took off my shirt and pulled my pants down to my ankles. With my shoes still on my feet, I mounted her. It was the first time we’d done it in the living room. It didn’t last long; it wasn’t spectacular—we only did missionary—but it was good enough to make us both moan, groan, and come.</p>
      <p>I light a cigarette, open Instagram, and send her a meme.</p>

      <h2>Así las cosas</h2>
      <p>Últimamente he estado pensando mucho en mi ex. Probablemente sea la falta de sexo, llevo un par de meses sin coger. El sexo con ella era demasiado bueno. En ocasiones yo no tenía que hacer nada, solo me acostaba y ella hacía el resto: sexo oral inolvidable, se montaba y se movía como si no hubiera un mañana. Recuerdo la última vez que lo hicimos. Fue cuando me entregó todas mis cosas. Pude haberlas dejado, pero hay algo implícito en “Ven por tus cosas”, es una forma en la que te das cuenta cómo va a terminar todo. Pudo haberme dicho “Te mando tus cosas” o “Tiré tus cosas”, hay veces en que las cosas ni siquiera sobreviven: se pierden, se olvidan o no vale la pena mencionarlas nunca más. En fin, ella me dijo que pasara por ellas. Aún tenía cosas que reclamarme, y yo tuve una oportunidad para explicarme. La sangre efervesce cuando sacas los sentimientos y abres las entrañas del pasado: recuerdos, situaciones, miradas. Has tomado diferentes botellas: dulces, amargas, agrias. Cuando al fin terminas de discutir hay un sentimiento de calma, como cuando sales después de nadar en el mar, te sientes un poco mareado y te cuesta trabajo caminar; pero aún queda algo vacío. La abracé y le pedí perdón. Recargó su cabeza en mi pecho y acarició mi barriga, creo que estaba llorando. Empecé a tener una erección y puse su mano dentro de mi pantalón. La tomé del mentón, y ella empezó a besarme casi de forma agresiva, no era un beso apasionado, ni amoroso, era como si buscara algo que le pertenecía, como un reclamo. La jalé del cabello y le lamí el cuello, justo debajo de la oreja. Me empujó y se acostó mientras se quitaba los jeans. Era la primera vez que lo hacíamos en el sofá de la sala. No duró mucho, sólo lo hicimos de misionero, pero fue suficiente para hacernos gritar y venirnos.</p>
      <p>Prendo un cigarrillo. Abro Instagram. Le envío un meme.</p>

      <h2>Chuck E. Cheese</h2>
      <p>I started to go to Chuck E. Cheese to meet single moms. It didn’t occur to me before; the first time I went was just to make time before a movie. It was in the same mall as the theater, so I went in and bought a 30-min playing card. I played hoops, brawling, Plants vs. Zombies, and Mario Kart. There were a lot of grandmothers and a lot of mothers—both of them hot (around my age and even younger); almost no men, definitely more male workers than visitors. It was overwhelming; for every game there were around 2 kids and a hot mom; that was roughly my analytics. I felt eyes on me, and it felt pretty good. Sure, because I was the only adult with no child playing in there, they probably thought I was either an immature adult or a pervert; still, the attention felt good. Movie time was in 10 min, sadly, so I had a slice of pizza and a Coke to enjoy the view for just a little more. I noticed there was a zombie-shooting game that everyone was in line to play. I finished the pizza and left for the theater. The film was outstanding. I’d been waiting all year for the film to come out, but I was still thinking of that freaking Chuck E. Cheese—what a wonderful place.</p>
      <p>So I went the next day. I had a slice of pizza and watched. I had an advantage: all the fathers were dying to get out of there; you could see they were uncomfortable. Mothers seemed to enjoy their time with their children, grandmothers were chitchatting, and the kids were all shouting and running all over. And finally, there I was, really enjoying being there, except for the children maybe; they annoyed me, but I had to give it to them—it was their fault the food court looked like a runway. There was again that shooting game, crowded. A young woman was playing; she had a long ponytail, light brown hair, beautiful body shape in an Adidas sweatshirt and white Sambas; she seemed even more attractive holding a gun and shooting zombies, the perfect partner for the apocalypse. She was killed a couple of times, but she kept going on.</p>
      <p>I finished eating and approached, skipped the line, and asked if she cared to join her. She said no with her head. I slid my card and started shooting next to her. We advanced smoothly, speechless, until the last stage. There was a giant zombie; it killed me, and she started cursing. I slid my card again. We finally killed it and celebrated, putting our hands in the air. That was the first time we made eye contact.</p>
      <p>“Damn. That was intense!” I said to myself.</p>
      <p>“Indeed it was,” she replied with relief. We made a fist bump. Another killing-round began. We both grabbed our guns and started shooting again.</p>
      <p>“So, your kid is not allowed to kill zombies?” I finally said after killing 10 zombies or so.</p>
      <p>“He’s left with his father.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, are they all right?”</p>
      <p>“I think so; today is his day with him.”</p>
      <p>“Sorry to hear it didn’t work out for you.”</p>
      <p>““It never worked out,” she replied with a calm seriousness. “And where is yours?”</p>
      <p>“Mine?”</p>
      <p>“Your kid.” Fuck! I didn’t see this coming.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have one,” I said quickly.</p>
      <p>“So what are you doing here?”</p>
      <p>“Honestly, I wanted to finish this game before the movie.” It was a pretty good little lie. I was surprised by my creativity.</p>
      <p>“Same; since I was already here, I wanted to have a little fun before leaving. Everyone in line gave me FOMO.”</p>
      <p>“I know!”</p>
      <p>“What are you doing after?” I was killed. I slid my card.</p>
      <p>“It’s girls’ night.”</p>
      <p>“Sounds like fun.”</p>
      <p>“What movie are you watching?”</p>
      <p>“Dune.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, I haven’t watched it! It’s kind of difficult to go to the movies when sleep time is at 8 p.m.”</p>
      <p>“Bummer; you could join me if it wasn’t girls’ night.”</p>
      <p>“Hahaha, not your lucky day.” She was killed; she slid her card.</p>
      <p>“Maybe it is; you turned out to be a good zombie-killing partner.”</p>
      <p>“I can’t let my girls down. You are the enemy, you know.”</p>
      <p>“Well, it seems to me that zombies are the real enemy right now.”</p>
      <p>“So you saw me playing and came to try some luck, huh?” Some kids were chasing each other around us.</p>
      <p>“You seemed like you needed a little help.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, really? Because I’m a woman?”</p>
      <p>“Nah, I just saw you were being killed here, and you didn’t seem to leave the game. Aaand I didn’t want to get in the line.”</p>
      <p>We played for another 15 minutes, but it felt like an hour since the place was noisy and chaotic. The people behind us left after they noticed we were not leaving. Last stage: 3 giant zombies—can you believe that? The cursing began again; we were killed again and again, and all the shouting and running of the freaking kids put me on the edge, but we were not quitting until the last motherfucker zombie was killed. We finally finished the game. There was an awkward pause.</p>
      <p>“So, next week, same time? Maybe we can try Jurassic Park,” I said—the first thing that came to mind.</p>
      <p>“Maybe,” she said and narrowed her eyes.</p>
      <p>“Luckily Dune afterwards?”</p>
      <p>“We’ll see about that. Have a fun weekend,” and she left, waving.</p>
      <p>Next weekend I was there, at the same time, at the same table, having pizza and a Coke. I didn’t see her. I finished eating, but I didn’t feel like playing. I was already there, though, so I tried a couple of racing games. The best ones had kids trying to drive; there should be a minimum age to play certain games—some of them are just a waste of dumb children figuring out how to play it. I tried a couple, but this time the place was more crowded. The shouting around me got on my nerves. When I got out of the booth I saw her with her kid, walking slowly, choosing a game, I suppose. She saw me and smiled slightly. I approached since we were just a couple of games apart. She was wearing a totally different outfit: high-waist dress pants, knitted cardigan, white Sambas again, and a cap—all white and black combined, like a chess board or a piano.</p>
      <p>“Hey! I thought you wouldn’t make it,” I said while coming closer. A man came from behind her. Her shoulders hitched up, and she looked fidgety, but we couldn’t do anything since we were all facing each other. Even the little kid noticed there was something going on; he was staring at all of us with his head facing up and his eyes wide open.</p>
      <p>“This is the father of Jim.” She pointed at him with her hand, like those ads presenting something, and hid her eyes on the face of the kid.</p>
      <p>“How are you doing?” the husband said, grabbing my hand pretty hard. Little Jim was still watching; then he got distracted.</p>
      <p>“I wanna play this one!” And Jim ran to the next game.</p>
      <p>“I’ll go with him,” she said and walked away. The father and I just stood right there.</p>
      <p>“So, are you friends with Elena?” he said through gritted teeth.</p>
      <p>“Not really, more like a shooting partner,” I said. He seemed confused. “We met at the arcade over there,” I added.</p>
      <p>“I see. So you bring your kids here often?”</p>
      <p>“Just when I come to the movies. I don’t have kids.” He seemed even more confused and stared at me suspiciously. I also stared.</p>
      <p>“All right, man. I’m gonna check on Jim and Elena,” and he left.</p>
      <p>I didn’t know what to do, so I played Mario Kart since it was close to the exit and empty. A 5-6-year-old joined the game; he won the first 3 races. I got mad and raced him and won the next 2. We played probably for half an hour. The little kid won the last 2 races. I got bored, and my card ran out of credits.</p>
      <p>“I thought you left,” I heard over me. I turned my head up, and there she was.</p>
      <p>“I needed to kick this kid’s ass.”</p>
      <p>“I kicked yours, old man,” said the little kid while still playing.</p>
      <p>“That’s fair! All yours, little guy,” I said and got up.</p>
      <p>“Loser!” he added exactly when me and Elena faced each other. I smiled and raised my eyebrows.</p>
      <p>“Kids never lie, huh,” she finally said to me.</p>
      <p>“I’m sorry if I put you in a difficult position back there.”</p>
      <p>“Nah, don’t worry about it; they are still around playing.”</p>
      <p>“Sooo,” I said, dubitative.</p>
      <p>“So?” she replied, raising her eyebrows.</p>
      <p>“Do you want to get out of here?”</p>
      <p>“Oh, yes!” she replied, and we walked to the mall.</p>
      <p>“So, did Jim’s father get upset?”</p>
      <p>“I don’t care what he thinks. He’s a cheater,” I didn’t expect that. I didn’t say anything, but she kept going, “but he always was. Even before Jimmy. After he was born I thought he could change.”</p>
      <p>“I guess old habits never die,” and we walked a couple of steps in silence. “Okay, look. My first option was to check the time of Dune right now, but what do you say if we get out of this mall and do something else.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, sounds good. I come here almost every weekend.” We walked to the parking lot.</p>
      <p>“Your perfume smells quite nice.” I also liked her style, her voice, her face, body, hands, hair, and walking. But I just said that.</p>
      <p>“Thanks.” Her phone rang. She looked at it for a couple of seconds and answered.</p>
      <p>“Hey…” Her face changed all of a sudden.</p>
      <p>“ARE YOU SERIOUS?” she said a bit louder and stopped walking.</p>
      <p>“Did you guys have anything to eat at least?” She touched her forehead.</p>
      <p>“It’s okay… Don’t worry about it… I’m on my way.” She hung up.</p>
      <p>“Everything cool?” I said, knowing there was something going on.</p>
      <p>“It was Jim’s father. He’s got an emergency of some sort, and he can’t take Jim with him.” Her face turned somewhat red, and she stared at the ground for some seconds. I realized that was the first time I saw her face in detail. She had lovely lips and eyebrows. We’ve probably been shoulder to shoulder since we met. “I’m so sorry; I have to get back,” she finally said.</p>
      <p>“It’s all good. Don’t worry about it. I’ll walk with you.” I lied. I was hoping to get some action.</p>
      <p>“FUCK! I can’t have a moment to myself,” she finally said and began walking back.</p>
      <p>“Maybe their grandparents can watch him?” I don’t know why I said that. I felt weird; all of a sudden everything went to shit.</p>
      <p>“That’s not the point. Jim’s looking forward all week to meeting his dad, and I’m sure it is not even an emergency, probably one of his women is begging for attention.”</p>
      <p>“Okay, look. Now I’m thinking you really need to watch a movie; it’ll help you clear your mind. Let’s see if there’s something we can watch with Jimmy. What do you say?”</p>
      <p>“You don’t have to do this; just go, we’ll be fine.” Her voice cracked a little. I sneaked a glance; her face was still red.</p>
      <p>“This could be fun,” I said, and she remained silent; she seemed really annoyed. “Don’t let him under your skin.” She looked at me and nodded, but I couldn’t read her stare; she remained walking quietly. Jim and his father were already at the entrance waiting. I grabbed her arm gently and stood in front of her, giving my back to Jim and his father. “Okay, look. It’s really nothing.” It was the first time I could see her eyes that close; they were red but also had a beautiful light brown color, almost like honey. “I’ll wait for you guys in the cafe over there. We can grab a bite and have some fun, ok?” She nodded more calmly, almost resigned. “All right. See you in a bit,” I said and walked away without looking back. I took the electric stairs and then turned back. They were arguing; I could tell by how they were moving their arms. I got to the cafe, sat in the cabinet close to the entrance, ordered a cappuccino, and waited. It was almost evening, but when I don’t know what to drink I always go for a coffee—it feels good, like a hug. There were mostly old couples eating, some families, and some loners. The café had wooden furniture with red leather stools in the bar and low-light glass lamps on each table. I had already finished the coffee. I felt nervous. What would he think, and what was she thinking—going out with a kid and a total stranger she met in the arcade? I’ve never been good with kids. Should I just speak to the mother and ignore the kid? What would we even talk about? I can’t flirt with her, or talk dirty, or talk about her dating life or anything. Probably it was best if she didn’t appear, or if I left. I ordered the check, and I regretted not ordering something with alcohol. I was dying for a ciggy; it was the best way to kill time. It was still early; I could smoke a joint and be on time for the playoffs. The check came, and I saw them both entering and walking toward me, holding hands. I felt funny. I put my card in the folder and gave it away.</p>
      <p>“Hey, sorry if we kept you waiting. Jimmy here had to go to the bathroom,” she said and moved the chairs so they could sit.</p>
      <p>“No worries. How are you doing, Jim?” The mom put him in a chair and sat.</p>
      <p>“Who are you?” he said, looking right up to me.</p>
      <p>“I’m friends with your mother. And now a friend of yours.” I’m really a stranger; I don’t know you nor your mother. But I was hoping to get down her panties. That’s what I really wanted to say.</p>
      <p>“But my mom only has girlfriends.”</p>
      <p>“Well, she’s giving this guy a chance now.” Jimmy laughed.</p>
      <p>The waitress came by. “So, what can I get the beautiful fam?”</p>
      <p>“Oh, we’re not…” I didn’t want to make things awkward, so I just played along. “ready yet… But I heard you have pretty good burgers here; would you like to try them?” I said, looking at all of them, even the waitress.</p>
      <p>“That’s our best seller here,” said the waitress, helping me out.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s fine for us,” finally said the mother after a quick look at the menu.</p>
      <p>“Sweet! Then we’ll have 3 smashed burgers and the triple plate with the onion rings, cheesy fingers, and the fries.”</p>
      <p>“Great choice, and to drink?” added the waitress.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Jim, do you like milkshakes?” He nodded. “Chocolate or vanilla?”</p>
      <p>“Cookies and cream.”</p>
      <p>“All right! He knows his thing, and you?” I looked at the mother; she was smiling slightly.</p>
      <p>“Pink lemonade, please,” she said to the waitress.</p>
      <p>“And a Coke for me.” The waitress left.</p>
      <p>“Do you like the movies, Jim? I want to invite you and your mommy to the movies.”</p>
      <p>“YES! Mom, can we get popcorn and ICEE?” the kid said with enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see. You gotta eat your meal first.”</p>
      <p>“So, have you watched Spider-verse yet?” I asked the kid.</p>
      <p>“All my friends went to see it, but I haven’t.”</p>
      <p>“Are you kidding? Well, today is your lucky day.” I didn’t really know why I was being so condescending with the kid.</p>
      <p>“Do you like Minecraft?” asked me Jimmy.</p>
      <p>He started talking about Minecraft and Twitch. I said I didn’t like it. I preferred racing, shooting, or adventures, like Hollow Knight or Zelda, and we talked about video games for a little while. The drinks arrived. I took a sip of the Coke. Tim’s milkshake looked delicious; he drank almost half of it straight down. The mom didn’t drink at all. She was quiet but relaxed. I didn’t know if I needed to speak to her or what; so far I’ve talked more with the kid than with her.</p>
      <p>“So, Jimmy! What do you guys do for fun?”</p>
      <p>“Oh! We don’t really; we mostly do chores and homework,” answered the kid in a small, wistful voice.</p>
      <p>“Bummer. So what do you really do for fun, Elena?” The burgers arrived. She took a fry and passed one to little Jim, then a cheesy finger, and took a sip of the lemonade. She made up her mind.</p>
      <p>“It’s not really fun, but I like reading.” I was glad; finally something to talk about.</p>
      <p>“Oh, tell me more,” I said and took a bite of the burger.</p>
      <p>“Well, it’s a convenient hobby when you’re between several things at once. I find the time to clear my head and relax for a couple of pages,” she took another sip of the lemonade. “Then Jim calls me, or the laundry is ready, it’s dinner time, or someone is ringing. Then I just stop, put the book down, do what I have to do, and pick it up again right where I left off.”</p>
      <p>“It’s like freezing time,” I said and took another bite of the burger.</p>
      <p>“Yeah… kind of, I think.” We went quiet for a second, then all took a bite of our burgers.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Jimmy! Can I try your shake?” He nodded. I took a fry and chopped it in the shake.</p>
      <p>“What are you doing!?” said Jimmy, laughing incredulously.</p>
      <p>“C’mon, you haven’t tried this?” I said, looking at both of them.</p>
      <p>“My parents don’t let me play with the food.”</p>
      <p>“It’s not really playing; it’s just having fun and trying new things. Haven’t you seen Ratatouille?” He shook his head.</p>
      <p>“Man, what are they teaching kids these days?” Jim chopped a fry in the shake. The mother didn’t seem bothered.</p>
      <p>“Try it, Mommy; it’s good!”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Come on! Try new things like he says,” the kid pointed at me.</p>
      <p>“Yeah! It can’t taste worse than your day earlier,” I said to her. She smiled more and almost let a laugh out.</p>
      <p>“You are all right, little fella. You are all right!” I said, smiling to Jimmy.</p>
      <p>We finished our burgers and left for the movie theater. I knew right then I was ready to be a father.</p>

        <article data-id="chapter-2" data-lang="es" hidden>
          <h2>Chuck E. Cheese</h2>
          <p>I started to go to Chuck E. Cheese to meet single moms. It didn’t occur to me before; the first time I went was just to make time before a movie. It was in the same mall as the theater, so I went in and bought a 30-min playing card. I played hoops, brawling, Plants vs. Zombies, and Mario Kart. There were a lot of grandmothers and a lot of mothers—both of them hot (around my age and even younger); almost no men, definitely more male workers than visitors. It was overwhelming; for every game there were around 2 kids and a hot mom; that was roughly my analytics. I felt eyes on me, and it felt pretty good. Sure, because I was the only adult with no child playing in there, they probably thought I was either an immature adult or a pervert; still, the attention felt good. Movie time was in 10 min, sadly, so I had a slice of pizza and a Coke to enjoy the view for just a little more. I noticed there was a zombie-shooting game that everyone was in line to play. I finished the pizza and left for the theater. The film was outstanding. I’d been waiting all year for the film to come out, but I was still thinking of that freaking Chuck E. Cheese—what a wonderful place.</p>
          <p>So I went the next day. I had a slice of pizza and watched. I had an advantage: all the fathers were dying to get out of there; you could see they were uncomfortable. Mothers seemed to enjoy their time with their children, grandmothers were chitchatting, and the kids were all shouting and running all over. And finally, there I was, really enjoying being there, except for the children maybe; they annoyed me, but I had to give it to them—it was their fault the food court looked like a runway. There was again that shooting game, crowded. A young woman was playing; she had a long ponytail, light brown hair, beautiful body shape in an Adidas sweatshirt and white Sambas; she seemed even more attractive holding a gun and shooting zombies, the perfect partner for the apocalypse. She was killed a couple of times, but she kept going on.</p>
          <p>I finished eating and approached, skipped the line, and asked if she cared to join her. She said no with her head. I slid my card and started shooting next to her. We advanced smoothly, speechless, until the last stage. There was a giant zombie; it killed me, and she started cursing. I slid my card again. We finally killed it and celebrated, putting our hands in the air. That was the first time we made eye contact.</p>
          <p>“Damn. That was intense!” I said to myself.</p>
          <p>“Indeed it was,” she replied with relief. We made a fist bump. Another killing-round began. We both grabbed our guns and started shooting again.</p>
          <p>“So, your kid is not allowed to kill zombies?” I finally said after killing 10 zombies or so.</p>
          <p>“He’s left with his father.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, are they all right?”</p>
          <p>“I think so; today is his day with him.”</p>
          <p>“Sorry to hear it didn’t work out for you.”</p>
          <p>““It never worked out,” she replied with a calm seriousness. “And where is yours?”</p>
          <p>“Mine?”</p>
          <p>“Your kid.” Fuck! I didn’t see this coming.</p>
          <p>“I don’t have one,” I said quickly.</p>
          <p>“So what are you doing here?”</p>
          <p>“Honestly, I wanted to finish this game before the movie.” It was a pretty good little lie. I was surprised by my creativity.</p>
          <p>“Same; since I was already here, I wanted to have a little fun before leaving. Everyone in line gave me FOMO.”</p>
          <p>“I know!”</p>
          <p>“What are you doing after?” I was killed. I slid my card.</p>
          <p>“It’s girls’ night.”</p>
          <p>“Sounds like fun.”</p>
          <p>“What movie are you watching?”</p>
          <p>“Dune.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I haven’t watched it! It’s kind of difficult to go to the movies when sleep time is at 8 p.m.”</p>
          <p>“Bummer; you could join me if it wasn’t girls’ night.”</p>
          <p>“Hahaha, not your lucky day.” She was killed; she slid her card.</p>
          <p>“Maybe it is; you turned out to be a good zombie-killing partner.”</p>
          <p>“I can’t let my girls down. You are the enemy, you know.”</p>
          <p>“Well, it seems to me that zombies are the real enemy right now.”</p>
          <p>“So you saw me playing and came to try some luck, huh?” Some kids were chasing each other around us.</p>
          <p>“You seemed like you needed a little help.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, really? Because I’m a woman?”</p>
          <p>“Nah, I just saw you were being killed here, and you didn’t seem to leave the game. Aaand I didn’t want to get in the line.”</p>
          <p>We played for another 15 minutes, but it felt like an hour since the place was noisy and chaotic. The people behind us left after they noticed we were not leaving. Last stage: 3 giant zombies—can you believe that? The cursing began again; we were killed again and again, and all the shouting and running of the freaking kids put me on the edge, but we were not quitting until the last motherfucker zombie was killed. We finally finished the game. There was an awkward pause.</p>
          <p>“So, next week, same time? Maybe we can try Jurassic Park,” I said—the first thing that came to mind.</p>
          <p>“Maybe,” she said and narrowed her eyes.</p>
          <p>“Luckily Dune afterwards?”</p>
          <p>“We’ll see about that. Have a fun weekend,” and she left, waving.</p>
          <p>Next weekend I was there, at the same time, at the same table, having pizza and a Coke. I didn’t see her. I finished eating, but I didn’t feel like playing. I was already there, though, so I tried a couple of racing games. The best ones had kids trying to drive; there should be a minimum age to play certain games—some of them are just a waste of dumb children figuring out how to play it. I tried a couple, but this time the place was more crowded. The shouting around me got on my nerves. When I got out of the booth I saw her with her kid, walking slowly, choosing a game, I suppose. She saw me and smiled slightly. I approached since we were just a couple of games apart. She was wearing a totally different outfit: high-waist dress pants, knitted cardigan, white Sambas again, and a cap—all white and black combined, like a chess board or a piano.</p>
          <p>“Hey! I thought you wouldn’t make it,” I said while coming closer. A man came from behind her. Her shoulders hitched up, and she looked fidgety, but we couldn’t do anything since we were all facing each other. Even the little kid noticed there was something going on; he was staring at all of us with his head facing up and his eyes wide open.</p>
          <p>“This is the father of Jim.” She pointed at him with her hand, like those ads presenting something, and hid her eyes on the face of the kid.</p>
          <p>“How are you doing?” the husband said, grabbing my hand pretty hard. Little Jim was still watching; then he got distracted.</p>
          <p>“I wanna play this one!” And Jim ran to the next game.</p>
          <p>“I’ll go with him,” she said and walked away. The father and I just stood right there.</p>
          <p>“So, are you friends with Elena?” he said through gritted teeth.</p>
          <p>“Not really, more like a shooting partner,” I said. He seemed confused. “We met at the arcade over there,” I added.</p>
          <p>“I see. So you bring your kids here often?”</p>
          <p>“Just when I come to the movies. I don’t have kids.” He seemed even more confused and stared at me suspiciously. I also stared.</p>
          <p>“All right, man. I’m gonna check on Jim and Elena,” and he left.</p>
          <p>I didn’t know what to do, so I played Mario Kart since it was close to the exit and empty. A 5-6-year-old joined the game; he won the first 3 races. I got mad and raced him and won the next 2. We played probably for half an hour. The little kid won the last 2 races. I got bored, and my card ran out of credits.</p>
          <p>“I thought you left,” I heard over me. I turned my head up, and there she was.</p>
          <p>“I needed to kick this kid’s ass.”</p>
          <p>“I kicked yours, old man,” said the little kid while still playing.</p>
          <p>“That’s fair! All yours, little guy,” I said and got up.</p>
          <p>“Loser!” he added exactly when me and Elena faced each other. I smiled and raised my eyebrows.</p>
          <p>“Kids never lie, huh,” she finally said to me.</p>
          <p>“I’m sorry if I put you in a difficult position back there.”</p>
          <p>“Nah, don’t worry about it; they are still around playing.”</p>
          <p>“Sooo,” I said, dubitative.</p>
          <p>“So?” she replied, raising her eyebrows.</p>
          <p>“Do you want to get out of here?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes!” she replied, and we walked to the mall.</p>
          <p>“So, did Jim’s father get upset?”</p>
          <p>“I don’t care what he thinks. He’s a cheater,” I didn’t expect that. I didn’t say anything, but she kept going, “but he always was. Even before Jimmy. After he was born I thought he could change.”</p>
          <p>“I guess old habits never die,” and we walked a couple of steps in silence. “Okay, look. My first option was to check the time of Dune right now, but what do you say if we get out of this mall and do something else.”</p>
          <p>“Yeah, sounds good. I come here almost every weekend.” We walked to the parking lot.</p>
          <p>“Your perfume smells quite nice.” I also liked her style, her voice, her face, body, hands, hair, and walking. But I just said that.</p>
          <p>“Thanks.” Her phone rang. She looked at it for a couple of seconds and answered.</p>
          <p>“Hey…” Her face changed all of a sudden.</p>
          <p>“ARE YOU SERIOUS?” she said a bit louder and stopped walking.</p>
          <p>“Did you guys have anything to eat at least?” She touched her forehead.</p>
          <p>“It’s okay… Don’t worry about it… I’m on my way.” She hung up.</p>
          <p>“Everything cool?” I said, knowing there was something going on.</p>
          <p>“It was Jim’s father. He’s got an emergency of some sort, and he can’t take Jim with him.” Her face turned somewhat red, and she stared at the ground for some seconds. I realized that was the first time I saw her face in detail. She had lovely lips and eyebrows. We’ve probably been shoulder to shoulder since we met. “I’m so sorry; I have to get back,” she finally said.</p>
          <p>“It’s all good. Don’t worry about it. I’ll walk with you.” I lied. I was hoping to get some action.</p>
          <p>“FUCK! I can’t have a moment to myself,” she finally said and began walking back.</p>
          <p>“Maybe their grandparents can watch him?” I don’t know why I said that. I felt weird; all of a sudden everything went to shit.</p>
          <p>“That’s not the point. Jim’s looking forward all week to meeting his dad, and I’m sure it is not even an emergency, probably one of his women is begging for attention.”</p>
          <p>“Okay, look. Now I’m thinking you really need to watch a movie; it’ll help you clear your mind. Let’s see if there’s something we can watch with Jimmy. What do you say?”</p>
          <p>“You don’t have to do this; just go, we’ll be fine.” Her voice cracked a little. I sneaked a glance; her face was still red.</p>
          <p>“This could be fun,” I said, and she remained silent; she seemed really annoyed. “Don’t let him under your skin.” She looked at me and nodded, but I couldn’t read her stare; she remained walking quietly. Jim and his father were already at the entrance waiting. I grabbed her arm gently and stood in front of her, giving my back to Jim and his father. “Okay, look. It’s really nothing.” It was the first time I could see her eyes that close; they were red but also had a beautiful light brown color, almost like honey. “I’ll wait for you guys in the cafe over there. We can grab a bite and have some fun, ok?” She nodded more calmly, almost resigned. “All right. See you in a bit,” I said and walked away without looking back. I took the electric stairs and then turned back. They were arguing; I could tell by how they were moving their arms. I got to the cafe, sat in the cabinet close to the entrance, ordered a cappuccino, and waited. It was almost evening, but when I don’t know what to drink I always go for a coffee—it feels good, like a hug. There were mostly old couples eating, some families, and some loners. The café had wooden furniture with red leather stools in the bar and low-light glass lamps on each table. I had already finished the coffee. I felt nervous. What would he think, and what was she thinking—going out with a kid and a total stranger she met in the arcade? I’ve never been good with kids. Should I just speak to the mother and ignore the kid? What would we even talk about? I can’t flirt with her, or talk dirty, or talk about her dating life or anything. Probably it was best if she didn’t appear, or if I left. I ordered the check, and I regretted not ordering something with alcohol. I was dying for a ciggy; it was the best way to kill time. It was still early; I could smoke a joint and be on time for the playoffs. The check came, and I saw them both entering and walking toward me, holding hands. I felt funny. I put my card in the folder and gave it away.</p>
          <p>“Hey, sorry if we kept you waiting. Jimmy here had to go to the bathroom,” she said and moved the chairs so they could sit.</p>
          <p>“No worries. How are you doing, Jim?” The mom put him in a chair and sat.</p>
          <p>“Who are you?” he said, looking right up to me.</p>
          <p>“I’m friends with your mother. And now a friend of yours.” I’m really a stranger; I don’t know you nor your mother. But I was hoping to get down her panties. That’s what I really wanted to say.</p>
          <p>“But my mom only has girlfriends.”</p>
          <p>“Well, she’s giving this guy a chance now.” Jimmy laughed.</p>
          <p>The waitress came by. “So, what can I get the beautiful fam?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, we’re not…” I didn’t want to make things awkward, so I just played along. “ready yet… But I heard you have pretty good burgers here; would you like to try them?” I said, looking at all of them, even the waitress.</p>
          <p>“That’s our best seller here,” said the waitress, helping me out.</p>
          <p>“I think it’s fine for us,” finally said the mother after a quick look at the menu.</p>
          <p>“Sweet! Then we’ll have 3 smashed burgers and the triple plate with the onion rings, cheesy fingers, and the fries.”</p>
          <p>“Great choice, and to drink?” added the waitress.</p>
          <p>“Hey, Jim, do you like milkshakes?” He nodded. “Chocolate or vanilla?”</p>
          <p>“Cookies and cream.”</p>
          <p>“All right! He knows his thing, and you?” I looked at the mother; she was smiling slightly.</p>
          <p>“Pink lemonade, please,” she said to the waitress.</p>
          <p>“And a Coke for me.” The waitress left.</p>
          <p>“Do you like the movies, Jim? I want to invite you and your mommy to the movies.”</p>
          <p>“YES! Mom, can we get popcorn and ICEE?” the kid said with enthusiasm.</p>
          <p>“We’ll see. You gotta eat your meal first.”</p>
          <p>“So, have you watched Spider-verse yet?” I asked the kid.</p>
          <p>“All my friends went to see it, but I haven’t.”</p>
          <p>“Are you kidding? Well, today is your lucky day.” I didn’t really know why I was being so condescending with the kid.</p>
          <p>“Do you like Minecraft?” asked me Jimmy.</p>
          <p>He started talking about Minecraft and Twitch. I said I didn’t like it. I preferred racing, shooting, or adventures, like Hollow Knight or Zelda, and we talked about video games for a little while. The drinks arrived. I took a sip of the Coke. Tim’s milkshake looked delicious; he drank almost half of it straight down. The mom didn’t drink at all. She was quiet but relaxed. I didn’t know if I needed to speak to her or what; so far I’ve talked more with the kid than with her.</p>
          <p>“So, Jimmy! What do you guys do for fun?”</p>
          <p>“Oh! We don’t really; we mostly do chores and homework,” answered the kid in a small, wistful voice.</p>
          <p>“Bummer. So what do you really do for fun, Elena?” The burgers arrived. She took a fry and passed one to little Jim, then a cheesy finger, and took a sip of the lemonade. She made up her mind.</p>
          <p>“It’s not really fun, but I like reading.” I was glad; finally something to talk about.</p>
          <p>“Oh, tell me more,” I said and took a bite of the burger.</p>
          <p>“Well, it’s a convenient hobby when you’re between several things at once. I find the time to clear my head and relax for a couple of pages,” she took another sip of the lemonade. “Then Jim calls me, or the laundry is ready, it’s dinner time, or someone is ringing. Then I just stop, put the book down, do what I have to do, and pick it up again right where I left off.”</p>
          <p>“It’s like freezing time,” I said and took another bite of the burger.</p>
          <p>“Yeah… kind of, I think.” We went quiet for a second, then all took a bite of our burgers.</p>
          <p>“Hey, Jimmy! Can I try your shake?” He nodded. I took a fry and chopped it in the shake.</p>
          <p>“What are you doing!?” said Jimmy, laughing incredulously.</p>
          <p>“C’mon, you haven’t tried this?” I said, looking at both of them.</p>
          <p>“My parents don’t let me play with the food.”</p>
          <p>“It’s not really playing; it’s just having fun and trying new things. Haven’t you seen Ratatouille?” He shook his head.</p>
          <p>“Man, what are they teaching kids these days?” Jim chopped a fry in the shake. The mother didn’t seem bothered.</p>
          <p>“Try it, Mommy; it’s good!”</p>
          <p>“I don’t know,” she said.</p>
          <p>“Come on! Try new things like he says,” the kid pointed at me.</p>
          <p>“Yeah! It can’t taste worse than your day earlier,” I said to her. She smiled more and almost let a laugh out.</p>
          <p>“You are all right, little fella. You are all right!” I said, smiling to Jimmy.</p>
          <p>We finished our burgers and left for the movie theater. I knew right then I was ready to be a father.</p>
