      <h2>Stuff and Such</h2>
      <p>I‚Äôve been thinking about my ex lately. Maybe it‚Äôs the lack of sex. Sex with her was unfairly good. Sometimes I didn‚Äôt have to do anything; I just lay there, and she did everything‚Äîamazing head, mounting and moving as if we were going to die the next day. I remember the last time we did it. She told me to come and pick up my stuff. She could have done anything with it, but there‚Äôs something unspoken in the stuff left behind: you can tell how everything is going to end. She might have said ‚ÄúI got rid of it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send it to you.‚Äù Sometimes, the stuff doesn't even survive; it‚Äôs lost, forgotten, and not even worth mentioning. Anyhow, she asked me to come and get my stuff. But there were still many things left unsaid, and I had the chance to explain myself. She cried. I wrapped my arms around her, and she rested her head on my chest. You feel vulnerable when you open up about your emotions, like you‚Äôre digging through the guts of the past‚Äîthe memories, the glances, the moments. When the arguing is finally over, there‚Äôs a sense of relief, almost like when you‚Äôre on solid ground again after drowning in the open sea, but there‚Äôs still a void inside. You‚Äôve tasted every bottle in the emotional cellar: sweet, bitter, sour. She softly rubbed my belly. I got hard and placed her hand down there. She grabbed it firmly. I turned her face and kissed her gently on the lips. She kissed me back madly, putting her tongue inside my mouth, almost as if she were claiming something. I pulled her hair back and licked her neck. She pushed me back, lay down on the couch, and slid off her jeans. I immediately took off my shirt and pulled my pants down to my ankles. With my shoes still on my feet, I mounted her. It was the first time we‚Äôd done it in the living room. It didn‚Äôt last long; it wasn‚Äôt spectacular‚Äîwe only did missionary‚Äîbut it was good enough to make us both moan, groan, and come.</p>
      <p>I light a cigarette, open Instagram, and send her a meme.</p>

      <h2>As√≠ las cosas</h2>
      <p>√öltimamente he estado pensando mucho en mi ex. Probablemente sea la falta de sexo, llevo un par de meses sin coger. El sexo con ella era demasiado bueno. En ocasiones yo no ten√≠a que hacer nada, solo me acostaba y ella hac√≠a el resto: sexo oral inolvidable, se montaba y se mov√≠a como si no hubiera un ma√±ana. Recuerdo la √∫ltima vez que lo hicimos. Fue cuando me entreg√≥ todas mis cosas. Pude haberlas dejado, pero hay algo impl√≠cito en ‚ÄúVen por tus cosas‚Äù, es una forma en la que te das cuenta c√≥mo va a terminar todo. Pudo haberme dicho ‚ÄúTe mando tus cosas‚Äù o ‚ÄúTir√© tus cosas‚Äù, hay veces en que las cosas ni siquiera sobreviven: se pierden, se olvidan o no vale la pena mencionarlas nunca m√°s. En fin, ella me dijo que pasara por ellas. A√∫n ten√≠a cosas que reclamarme, y yo tuve una oportunidad para explicarme. La sangre efervesce cuando sacas los sentimientos y abres las entra√±as del pasado: recuerdos, situaciones, miradas. Has tomado diferentes botellas: dulces, amargas, agrias. Cuando al fin terminas de discutir hay un sentimiento de calma, como cuando sales despu√©s de nadar en el mar, te sientes un poco mareado y te cuesta trabajo caminar; pero a√∫n queda algo vac√≠o. La abrac√© y le ped√≠ perd√≥n. Recarg√≥ su cabeza en mi pecho y acarici√≥ mi barriga, creo que estaba llorando. Empec√© a tener una erecci√≥n y puse su mano dentro de mi pantal√≥n. La tom√© del ment√≥n, y ella empez√≥ a besarme casi de forma agresiva, no era un beso apasionado, ni amoroso, era como si buscara algo que le pertenec√≠a, como un reclamo. La jal√© del cabello y le lam√≠ el cuello, justo debajo de la oreja. Me empuj√≥ y se acost√≥ mientras se quitaba los jeans. Era la primera vez que lo hac√≠amos en el sof√° de la sala. No dur√≥ mucho, s√≥lo lo hicimos de misionero, pero fue suficiente para hacernos gritar y venirnos.</p>
      <p>Prendo un cigarrillo. Abro Instagram. Le env√≠o un meme.</p>
      <p><i>Visto hace un momento.</i></p><p>Ahora s√≥lo tengo que esperar.</p>

      <h2>Chuck E. Cheese</h2>
      <p>I started to go to Chuck E. Cheese to meet single moms. It didn‚Äôt occur to me before; the first time I went was just to make time before a movie. It was in the same mall as the theater, so I went in and bought a 30-min playing card. I played hoops, brawling, Plants vs. Zombies, and Mario Kart. There were a lot of grandmothers and a lot of mothers‚Äîboth of them hot (around my age and even younger); almost no men, definitely more male workers than visitors. It was overwhelming; for every game there were around 2 kids and a hot mom; that was roughly my analytics. I felt eyes on me, and it felt pretty good. Sure, because I was the only adult with no child playing in there, they probably thought I was either an immature adult or a pervert; still, the attention felt good. Movie time was in 10 min, sadly, so I had a slice of pizza and a Coke to enjoy the view for just a little more. I noticed there was a zombie-shooting game that everyone was in line to play. I finished the pizza and left for the theater. The film was outstanding. I‚Äôd been waiting all year for the film to come out, but I was still thinking of that freaking Chuck E. Cheese‚Äîwhat a wonderful place.</p>
      <p>So I went the next day. I had a slice of pizza and watched. I had an advantage: all the fathers were dying to get out of there; you could see they were uncomfortable. Mothers seemed to enjoy their time with their children, grandmothers were chitchatting, and the kids were all shouting and running all over. And finally, there I was, really enjoying being there, except for the children maybe; they annoyed me, but I had to give it to them‚Äîit was their fault the food court looked like a runway. There was again that shooting game, crowded. A young woman was playing; she had a long ponytail, light brown hair, beautiful body shape in an Adidas sweatshirt and white Sambas; she seemed even more attractive holding a gun and shooting zombies, the perfect partner for the apocalypse. She was killed a couple of times, but she kept going on.</p>
      <p>I finished eating and approached, skipped the line, and asked if she cared to join her. She said no with her head. I slid my card and started shooting next to her. We advanced smoothly, speechless, until the last stage. There was a giant zombie; it killed me, and she started cursing. I slid my card again. We finally killed it and celebrated, putting our hands in the air. That was the first time we made eye contact.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúDamn. That was intense!‚Äù I said to myself.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúIndeed it was,‚Äù she replied with relief. We made a fist bump. Another killing-round began. We both grabbed our guns and started shooting again.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSo, your kid is not allowed to kill zombies?‚Äù I finally said after killing 10 zombies or so.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs left with his father.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúOh, are they all right?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI think so; today is his day with him.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSorry to hear it didn‚Äôt work out for you.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚Äú‚ÄúIt never worked out,‚Äù she replied with a calm seriousness. ‚ÄúAnd where is yours?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúMine?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúYour kid.‚Äù Fuck! I didn‚Äôt see this coming.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have one,‚Äù I said quickly.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSo what are you doing here?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúHonestly, I wanted to finish this game before the movie.‚Äù It was a pretty good little lie. I was surprised by my creativity.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSame; since I was already here, I wanted to have a little fun before leaving. Everyone in line gave me FOMO.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI know!‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWhat are you doing after?‚Äù I was killed. I slid my card.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs girls‚Äô night.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSounds like fun.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWhat movie are you watching?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúDune.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúOh, I haven‚Äôt watched it! It‚Äôs kind of difficult to go to the movies when sleep time is at 8 p.m.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúBummer; you could join me if it wasn‚Äôt girls‚Äô night.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúHahaha, not your lucky day.‚Äù She was killed; she slid her card.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúMaybe it is; you turned out to be a good zombie-killing partner.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let my girls down. You are the enemy, you know.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWell, it seems to me that zombies are the real enemy right now.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSo you saw me playing and came to try some luck, huh?‚Äù Some kids were chasing each other around us.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúYou seemed like you needed a little help.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúOh, really? Because I‚Äôm a woman?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúNah, I just saw you were being killed here, and you didn‚Äôt seem to leave the game. Aaand I didn‚Äôt want to get in the line.‚Äù</p>
      <p>We played for another 15 minutes, but it felt like an hour since the place was noisy and chaotic. The people behind us left after they noticed we were not leaving. Last stage: 3 giant zombies‚Äîcan you believe that? The cursing began again; we were killed again and again, and all the shouting and running of the freaking kids put me on the edge, but we were not quitting until the last motherfucker zombie was killed. We finally finished the game. There was an awkward pause.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSo, next week, same time? Maybe we can try Jurassic Park,‚Äù I said‚Äîthe first thing that came to mind.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù she said and narrowed her eyes.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúLuckily Dune afterwards?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see about that. Have a fun weekend,‚Äù and she left, waving.</p>
      <p>Next weekend I was there, at the same time, at the same table, having pizza and a Coke. I didn‚Äôt see her. I finished eating, but I didn‚Äôt feel like playing. I was already there, though, so I tried a couple of racing games. The best ones had kids trying to drive; there should be a minimum age to play certain games‚Äîsome of them are just a waste of dumb children figuring out how to play it. I tried a couple, but this time the place was more crowded. The shouting around me got on my nerves. When I got out of the booth I saw her with her kid, walking slowly, choosing a game, I suppose. She saw me and smiled slightly. I approached since we were just a couple of games apart. She was wearing a totally different outfit: high-waist dress pants, knitted cardigan, white Sambas again, and a cap‚Äîall white and black combined, like a chess board or a piano.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúHey! I thought you wouldn‚Äôt make it,‚Äù I said while coming closer. A man came from behind her. Her shoulders hitched up, and she looked fidgety, but we couldn‚Äôt do anything since we were all facing each other. Even the little kid noticed there was something going on; he was staring at all of us with his head facing up and his eyes wide open.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúThis is the father of Jim.‚Äù She pointed at him with her hand, like those ads presenting something, and hid her eyes on the face of the kid.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù the husband said, grabbing my hand pretty hard. Little Jim was still watching; then he got distracted.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI wanna play this one!‚Äù And Jim ran to the next game.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with him,‚Äù she said and walked away. The father and I just stood right there.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSo, are you friends with Elena?‚Äù he said through gritted teeth.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúNot really, more like a shooting partner,‚Äù I said. He seemed confused. ‚ÄúWe met at the arcade over there,‚Äù I added.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI see. So you bring your kids here often?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúJust when I come to the movies. I don‚Äôt have kids.‚Äù He seemed even more confused and stared at me suspiciously. I also stared.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúAll right, man. I‚Äôm gonna check on Jim and Elena,‚Äù and he left.</p>
      <p>I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I played Mario Kart since it was close to the exit and empty. A 5-6-year-old joined the game; he won the first 3 races. I got mad and raced him and won the next 2. We played probably for half an hour. The little kid won the last 2 races. I got bored, and my card ran out of credits.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI thought you left,‚Äù I heard over me. I turned my head up, and there she was.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI needed to kick this kid‚Äôs ass.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI kicked yours, old man,‚Äù said the little kid while still playing.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fair! All yours, little guy,‚Äù I said and got up.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúLoser!‚Äù he added exactly when me and Elena faced each other. I smiled and raised my eyebrows.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúKids never lie, huh,‚Äù she finally said to me.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I put you in a difficult position back there.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúNah, don‚Äôt worry about it; they are still around playing.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSooo,‚Äù I said, dubitative.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSo?‚Äù she replied, raising her eyebrows.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúDo you want to get out of here?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúOh, yes!‚Äù she replied, and we walked to the mall.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSo, did Jim‚Äôs father get upset?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what he thinks. He‚Äôs a cheater,‚Äù I didn‚Äôt expect that. I didn‚Äôt say anything, but she kept going, ‚Äúbut he always was. Even before Jimmy. After he was born I thought he could change.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI guess old habits never die,‚Äù and we walked a couple of steps in silence. ‚ÄúOkay, look. My first option was to check the time of Dune right now, but what do you say if we get out of this mall and do something else.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúYeah, sounds good. I come here almost every weekend.‚Äù We walked to the parking lot.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúYour perfume smells quite nice.‚Äù I also liked her style, her voice, her face, body, hands, hair, and walking. But I just said that.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù Her phone rang. She looked at it for a couple of seconds and answered.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶‚Äù Her face changed all of a sudden.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúARE YOU SERIOUS?‚Äù she said a bit louder and stopped walking.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúDid you guys have anything to eat at least?‚Äù She touched her forehead.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt worry about it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm on my way.‚Äù She hung up.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúEverything cool?‚Äù I said, knowing there was something going on.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúIt was Jim‚Äôs father. He‚Äôs got an emergency of some sort, and he can‚Äôt take Jim with him.‚Äù Her face turned somewhat red, and she stared at the ground for some seconds. I realized that was the first time I saw her face in detail. She had lovely lips and eyebrows. We‚Äôve probably been shoulder to shoulder since we met. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry; I have to get back,‚Äù she finally said.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all good. Don‚Äôt worry about it. I‚Äôll walk with you.‚Äù I lied. I was hoping to get some action.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúFUCK! I can‚Äôt have a moment to myself,‚Äù she finally said and began walking back.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúMaybe their grandparents can watch him?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why I said that. I felt weird; all of a sudden everything went to shit.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the point. Jim‚Äôs looking forward all week to meeting his dad, and I‚Äôm sure it is not even an emergency, probably one of his women is begging for attention.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúOkay, look. Now I‚Äôm thinking you really need to watch a movie; it‚Äôll help you clear your mind. Let‚Äôs see if there‚Äôs something we can watch with Jimmy. What do you say?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this; just go, we‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù Her voice cracked a little. I sneaked a glance; her face was still red.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúThis could be fun,‚Äù I said, and she remained silent; she seemed really annoyed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let him under your skin.‚Äù She looked at me and nodded, but I couldn‚Äôt read her stare; she remained walking quietly. Jim and his father were already at the entrance waiting. I grabbed her arm gently and stood in front of her, giving my back to Jim and his father. ‚ÄúOkay, look. It‚Äôs really nothing.‚Äù It was the first time I could see her eyes that close; they were red but also had a beautiful light brown color, almost like honey. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait for you guys in the cafe over there. We can grab a bite and have some fun, ok?‚Äù She nodded more calmly, almost resigned. ‚ÄúAll right. See you in a bit,‚Äù I said and walked away without looking back. I took the electric stairs and then turned back. They were arguing; I could tell by how they were moving their arms. I got to the cafe, sat in the cabinet close to the entrance, ordered a cappuccino, and waited. It was almost evening, but when I don‚Äôt know what to drink I always go for a coffee‚Äîit feels good, like a hug. There were mostly old couples eating, some families, and some loners. The caf√© had wooden furniture with red leather stools in the bar and low-light glass lamps on each table. I had already finished the coffee. I felt nervous. What would he think, and what was she thinking‚Äîgoing out with a kid and a total stranger she met in the arcade? I‚Äôve never been good with kids. Should I just speak to the mother and ignore the kid? What would we even talk about? I can‚Äôt flirt with her, or talk dirty, or talk about her dating life or anything. Probably it was best if she didn‚Äôt appear, or if I left. I ordered the check, and I regretted not ordering something with alcohol. I was dying for a ciggy; it was the best way to kill time. It was still early; I could smoke a joint and be on time for the playoffs. The check came, and I saw them both entering and walking toward me, holding hands. I felt funny. I put my card in the folder and gave it away.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúHey, sorry if we kept you waiting. Jimmy here had to go to the bathroom,‚Äù she said and moved the chairs so they could sit.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúNo worries. How are you doing, Jim?‚Äù The mom put him in a chair and sat.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he said, looking right up to me.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm friends with your mother. And now a friend of yours.‚Äù I‚Äôm really a stranger; I don‚Äôt know you nor your mother. But I was hoping to get down her panties. That‚Äôs what I really wanted to say.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúBut my mom only has girlfriends.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWell, she‚Äôs giving this guy a chance now.‚Äù Jimmy laughed.</p>
      <p>The waitress came by. ‚ÄúSo, what can I get the beautiful fam?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre not‚Ä¶‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to make things awkward, so I just played along. ‚Äúready yet‚Ä¶ But I heard you have pretty good burgers here; would you like to try them?‚Äù I said, looking at all of them, even the waitress.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our best seller here,‚Äù said the waitress, helping me out.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs fine for us,‚Äù finally said the mother after a quick look at the menu.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSweet! Then we‚Äôll have 3 smashed burgers and the triple plate with the onion rings, cheesy fingers, and the fries.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúGreat choice, and to drink?‚Äù added the waitress.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúHey, Jim, do you like milkshakes?‚Äù He nodded. ‚ÄúChocolate or vanilla?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúCookies and cream.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúAll right! He knows his thing, and you?‚Äù I looked at the mother; she was smiling slightly.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúPink lemonade, please,‚Äù she said to the waitress.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúAnd a Coke for me.‚Äù The waitress left.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúDo you like the movies, Jim? I want to invite you and your mommy to the movies.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúYES! Mom, can we get popcorn and ICEE?‚Äù the kid said with enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see. You gotta eat your meal first.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSo, have you watched Spider-verse yet?‚Äù I asked the kid.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúAll my friends went to see it, but I haven‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúAre you kidding? Well, today is your lucky day.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt really know why I was being so condescending with the kid.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúDo you like Minecraft?‚Äù asked me Jimmy.</p>
      <p>He started talking about Minecraft and Twitch. I said I didn‚Äôt like it. I preferred racing, shooting, or adventures, like Hollow Knight or Zelda, and we talked about video games for a little while. The drinks arrived. I took a sip of the Coke. Tim‚Äôs milkshake looked delicious; he drank almost half of it straight down. The mom didn‚Äôt drink at all. She was quiet but relaxed. I didn‚Äôt know if I needed to speak to her or what; so far I‚Äôve talked more with the kid than with her.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúSo, Jimmy! What do you guys do for fun?‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúOh! We don‚Äôt really; we mostly do chores and homework,‚Äù answered the kid in a small, wistful voice.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúBummer. So what do you really do for fun, Elena?‚Äù The burgers arrived. She took a fry and passed one to little Jim, then a cheesy finger, and took a sip of the lemonade. She made up her mind.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really fun, but I like reading.‚Äù I was glad; finally something to talk about.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúOh, tell me more,‚Äù I said and took a bite of the burger.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs a convenient hobby when you‚Äôre between several things at once. I find the time to clear my head and relax for a couple of pages,‚Äù she took another sip of the lemonade. ‚ÄúThen Jim calls me, or the laundry is ready, it‚Äôs dinner time, or someone is ringing. Then I just stop, put the book down, do what I have to do, and pick it up again right where I left off.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like freezing time,‚Äù I said and took another bite of the burger.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ kind of, I think.‚Äù We went quiet for a second, then all took a bite of our burgers.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúHey, Jimmy! Can I try your shake?‚Äù He nodded. I took a fry and chopped it in the shake.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWhat are you doing!?‚Äù said Jimmy, laughing incredulously.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúC‚Äômon, you haven‚Äôt tried this?‚Äù I said, looking at both of them.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúMy parents don‚Äôt let me play with the food.‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really playing; it‚Äôs just having fun and trying new things. Haven‚Äôt you seen Ratatouille?‚Äù He shook his head.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúMan, what are they teaching kids these days?‚Äù Jim chopped a fry in the shake. The mother didn‚Äôt seem bothered.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúTry it, Mommy; it‚Äôs good!‚Äù</p>
      <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúCome on! Try new things like he says,‚Äù the kid pointed at me.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúYeah! It can‚Äôt taste worse than your day earlier,‚Äù I said to her. She smiled more and almost let a laugh out.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúYou are all right, little fella. You are all right!‚Äù I said, smiling to Jimmy.</p>
      <p>We finished our burgers and left for the movie theater. I knew right then I was ready to be a father.</p>

        <!-- Cap√≠tulo 2 ES -->
        <article data-id="chapter-2" data-lang="es" hidden>
          <h2>Chuck E. Cheese</h2>
          <p>I started to go to Chuck E. Cheese to meet single moms. It didn‚Äôt occur to me before; the first time I went was just to make time before a movie. It was in the same mall as the theater, so I went in and bought a 30-min playing card. I played hoops, brawling, Plants vs. Zombies, and Mario Kart. There were a lot of grandmothers and a lot of mothers‚Äîboth of them hot (around my age and even younger); almost no men, definitely more male workers than visitors. It was overwhelming; for every game there were around 2 kids and a hot mom; that was roughly my analytics. I felt eyes on me, and it felt pretty good. Sure, because I was the only adult with no child playing in there, they probably thought I was either an immature adult or a pervert; still, the attention felt good. Movie time was in 10 min, sadly, so I had a slice of pizza and a Coke to enjoy the view for just a little more. I noticed there was a zombie-shooting game that everyone was in line to play. I finished the pizza and left for the theater. The film was outstanding. I‚Äôd been waiting all year for the film to come out, but I was still thinking of that freaking Chuck E. Cheese‚Äîwhat a wonderful place.</p>
          <p>So I went the next day. I had a slice of pizza and watched. I had an advantage: all the fathers were dying to get out of there; you could see they were uncomfortable. Mothers seemed to enjoy their time with their children, grandmothers were chitchatting, and the kids were all shouting and running all over. And finally, there I was, really enjoying being there, except for the children maybe; they annoyed me, but I had to give it to them‚Äîit was their fault the food court looked like a runway. There was again that shooting game, crowded. A young woman was playing; she had a long ponytail, light brown hair, beautiful body shape in an Adidas sweatshirt and white Sambas; she seemed even more attractive holding a gun and shooting zombies, the perfect partner for the apocalypse. She was killed a couple of times, but she kept going on.</p>
          <p>I finished eating and approached, skipped the line, and asked if she cared to join her. She said no with her head. I slid my card and started shooting next to her. We advanced smoothly, speechless, until the last stage. There was a giant zombie; it killed me, and she started cursing. I slid my card again. We finally killed it and celebrated, putting our hands in the air. That was the first time we made eye contact.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúDamn. That was intense!‚Äù I said to myself.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúIndeed it was,‚Äù she replied with relief. We made a fist bump. Another killing-round began. We both grabbed our guns and started shooting again.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSo, your kid is not allowed to kill zombies?‚Äù I finally said after killing 10 zombies or so.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs left with his father.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúOh, are they all right?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI think so; today is his day with him.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSorry to hear it didn‚Äôt work out for you.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚Äú‚ÄúIt never worked out,‚Äù she replied with a calm seriousness. ‚ÄúAnd where is yours?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúMine?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúYour kid.‚Äù Fuck! I didn‚Äôt see this coming.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have one,‚Äù I said quickly.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSo what are you doing here?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúHonestly, I wanted to finish this game before the movie.‚Äù It was a pretty good little lie. I was surprised by my creativity.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSame; since I was already here, I wanted to have a little fun before leaving. Everyone in line gave me FOMO.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI know!‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúWhat are you doing after?‚Äù I was killed. I slid my card.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs girls‚Äô night.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSounds like fun.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúWhat movie are you watching?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúDune.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúOh, I haven‚Äôt watched it! It‚Äôs kind of difficult to go to the movies when sleep time is at 8 p.m.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúBummer; you could join me if it wasn‚Äôt girls‚Äô night.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúHahaha, not your lucky day.‚Äù She was killed; she slid her card.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúMaybe it is; you turned out to be a good zombie-killing partner.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let my girls down. You are the enemy, you know.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúWell, it seems to me that zombies are the real enemy right now.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSo you saw me playing and came to try some luck, huh?‚Äù Some kids were chasing each other around us.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúYou seemed like you needed a little help.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúOh, really? Because I‚Äôm a woman?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúNah, I just saw you were being killed here, and you didn‚Äôt seem to leave the game. Aaand I didn‚Äôt want to get in the line.‚Äù</p>
          <p>We played for another 15 minutes, but it felt like an hour since the place was noisy and chaotic. The people behind us left after they noticed we were not leaving. Last stage: 3 giant zombies‚Äîcan you believe that? The cursing began again; we were killed again and again, and all the shouting and running of the freaking kids put me on the edge, but we were not quitting until the last motherfucker zombie was killed. We finally finished the game. There was an awkward pause.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSo, next week, same time? Maybe we can try Jurassic Park,‚Äù I said‚Äîthe first thing that came to mind.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù she said and narrowed her eyes.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúLuckily Dune afterwards?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see about that. Have a fun weekend,‚Äù and she left, waving.</p>
          <p>Next weekend I was there, at the same time, at the same table, having pizza and a Coke. I didn‚Äôt see her. I finished eating, but I didn‚Äôt feel like playing. I was already there, though, so I tried a couple of racing games. The best ones had kids trying to drive; there should be a minimum age to play certain games‚Äîsome of them are just a waste of dumb children figuring out how to play it. I tried a couple, but this time the place was more crowded. The shouting around me got on my nerves. When I got out of the booth I saw her with her kid, walking slowly, choosing a game, I suppose. She saw me and smiled slightly. I approached since we were just a couple of games apart. She was wearing a totally different outfit: high-waist dress pants, knitted cardigan, white Sambas again, and a cap‚Äîall white and black combined, like a chess board or a piano.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúHey! I thought you wouldn‚Äôt make it,‚Äù I said while coming closer. A man came from behind her. Her shoulders hitched up, and she looked fidgety, but we couldn‚Äôt do anything since we were all facing each other. Even the little kid noticed there was something going on; he was staring at all of us with his head facing up and his eyes wide open.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúThis is the father of Jim.‚Äù She pointed at him with her hand, like those ads presenting something, and hid her eyes on the face of the kid.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù the husband said, grabbing my hand pretty hard. Little Jim was still watching; then he got distracted.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI wanna play this one!‚Äù And Jim ran to the next game.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with him,‚Äù she said and walked away. The father and I just stood right there.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSo, are you friends with Elena?‚Äù he said through gritted teeth.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúNot really, more like a shooting partner,‚Äù I said. He seemed confused. ‚ÄúWe met at the arcade over there,‚Äù I added.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI see. So you bring your kids here often?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúJust when I come to the movies. I don‚Äôt have kids.‚Äù He seemed even more confused and stared at me suspiciously. I also stared.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúAll right, man. I‚Äôm gonna check on Jim and Elena,‚Äù and he left.</p>
          <p>I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I played Mario Kart since it was close to the exit and empty. A 5-6-year-old joined the game; he won the first 3 races. I got mad and raced him and won the next 2. We played probably for half an hour. The little kid won the last 2 races. I got bored, and my card ran out of credits.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI thought you left,‚Äù I heard over me. I turned my head up, and there she was.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI needed to kick this kid‚Äôs ass.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI kicked yours, old man,‚Äù said the little kid while still playing.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fair! All yours, little guy,‚Äù I said and got up.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúLoser!‚Äù he added exactly when me and Elena faced each other. I smiled and raised my eyebrows.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúKids never lie, huh,‚Äù she finally said to me.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I put you in a difficult position back there.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúNah, don‚Äôt worry about it; they are still around playing.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSooo,‚Äù I said, dubitative.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSo?‚Äù she replied, raising her eyebrows.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúDo you want to get out of here?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúOh, yes!‚Äù she replied, and we walked to the mall.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSo, did Jim‚Äôs father get upset?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what he thinks. He‚Äôs a cheater,‚Äù I didn‚Äôt expect that. I didn‚Äôt say anything, but she kept going, ‚Äúbut he always was. Even before Jimmy. After he was born I thought he could change.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI guess old habits never die,‚Äù and we walked a couple of steps in silence. ‚ÄúOkay, look. My first option was to check the time of Dune right now, but what do you say if we get out of this mall and do something else.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúYeah, sounds good. I come here almost every weekend.‚Äù We walked to the parking lot.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúYour perfume smells quite nice.‚Äù I also liked her style, her voice, her face, body, hands, hair, and walking. But I just said that.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù Her phone rang. She looked at it for a couple of seconds and answered.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶‚Äù Her face changed all of a sudden.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúARE YOU SERIOUS?‚Äù she said a bit louder and stopped walking.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúDid you guys have anything to eat at least?‚Äù She touched her forehead.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt worry about it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm on my way.‚Äù She hung up.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúEverything cool?‚Äù I said, knowing there was something going on.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúIt was Jim‚Äôs father. He‚Äôs got an emergency of some sort, and he can‚Äôt take Jim with him.‚Äù Her face turned somewhat red, and she stared at the ground for some seconds. I realized that was the first time I saw her face in detail. She had lovely lips and eyebrows. We‚Äôve probably been shoulder to shoulder since we met. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry; I have to get back,‚Äù she finally said.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all good. Don‚Äôt worry about it. I‚Äôll walk with you.‚Äù I lied. I was hoping to get some action.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúFUCK! I can‚Äôt have a moment to myself,‚Äù she finally said and began walking back.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúMaybe their grandparents can watch him?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why I said that. I felt weird; all of a sudden everything went to shit.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the point. Jim‚Äôs looking forward all week to meeting his dad, and I‚Äôm sure it is not even an emergency, probably one of his women is begging for attention.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúOkay, look. Now I‚Äôm thinking you really need to watch a movie; it‚Äôll help you clear your mind. Let‚Äôs see if there‚Äôs something we can watch with Jimmy. What do you say?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this; just go, we‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù Her voice cracked a little. I sneaked a glance; her face was still red.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúThis could be fun,‚Äù I said, and she remained silent; she seemed really annoyed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let him under your skin.‚Äù She looked at me and nodded, but I couldn‚Äôt read her stare; she remained walking quietly. Jim and his father were already at the entrance waiting. I grabbed her arm gently and stood in front of her, giving my back to Jim and his father. ‚ÄúOkay, look. It‚Äôs really nothing.‚Äù It was the first time I could see her eyes that close; they were red but also had a beautiful light brown color, almost like honey. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait for you guys in the cafe over there. We can grab a bite and have some fun, ok?‚Äù She nodded more calmly, almost resigned. ‚ÄúAll right. See you in a bit,‚Äù I said and walked away without looking back. I took the electric stairs and then turned back. They were arguing; I could tell by how they were moving their arms. I got to the cafe, sat in the cabinet close to the entrance, ordered a cappuccino, and waited. It was almost evening, but when I don‚Äôt know what to drink I always go for a coffee‚Äîit feels good, like a hug. There were mostly old couples eating, some families, and some loners. The caf√© had wooden furniture with red leather stools in the bar and low-light glass lamps on each table. I had already finished the coffee. I felt nervous. What would he think, and what was she thinking‚Äîgoing out with a kid and a total stranger she met in the arcade? I‚Äôve never been good with kids. Should I just speak to the mother and ignore the kid? What would we even talk about? I can‚Äôt flirt with her, or talk dirty, or talk about her dating life or anything. Probably it was best if she didn‚Äôt appear, or if I left. I ordered the check, and I regretted not ordering something with alcohol. I was dying for a ciggy; it was the best way to kill time. It was still early; I could smoke a joint and be on time for the playoffs. The check came, and I saw them both entering and walking toward me, holding hands. I felt funny. I put my card in the folder and gave it away.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúHey, sorry if we kept you waiting. Jimmy here had to go to the bathroom,‚Äù she said and moved the chairs so they could sit.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúNo worries. How are you doing, Jim?‚Äù The mom put him in a chair and sat.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he said, looking right up to me.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm friends with your mother. And now a friend of yours.‚Äù I‚Äôm really a stranger; I don‚Äôt know you nor your mother. But I was hoping to get down her panties. That‚Äôs what I really wanted to say.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúBut my mom only has girlfriends.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúWell, she‚Äôs giving this guy a chance now.‚Äù Jimmy laughed.</p>
          <p>The waitress came by. ‚ÄúSo, what can I get the beautiful fam?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre not‚Ä¶‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to make things awkward, so I just played along. ‚Äúready yet‚Ä¶ But I heard you have pretty good burgers here; would you like to try them?‚Äù I said, looking at all of them, even the waitress.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our best seller here,‚Äù said the waitress, helping me out.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs fine for us,‚Äù finally said the mother after a quick look at the menu.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSweet! Then we‚Äôll have 3 smashed burgers and the triple plate with the onion rings, cheesy fingers, and the fries.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúGreat choice, and to drink?‚Äù added the waitress.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúHey, Jim, do you like milkshakes?‚Äù He nodded. ‚ÄúChocolate or vanilla?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúCookies and cream.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúAll right! He knows his thing, and you?‚Äù I looked at the mother; she was smiling slightly.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúPink lemonade, please,‚Äù she said to the waitress.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúAnd a Coke for me.‚Äù The waitress left.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúDo you like the movies, Jim? I want to invite you and your mommy to the movies.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúYES! Mom, can we get popcorn and ICEE?‚Äù the kid said with enthusiasm.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see. You gotta eat your meal first.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSo, have you watched Spider-verse yet?‚Äù I asked the kid.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúAll my friends went to see it, but I haven‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúAre you kidding? Well, today is your lucky day.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt really know why I was being so condescending with the kid.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúDo you like Minecraft?‚Äù asked me Jimmy.</p>
          <p>He started talking about Minecraft and Twitch. I said I didn‚Äôt like it. I preferred racing, shooting, or adventures, like Hollow Knight or Zelda, and we talked about video games for a little while. The drinks arrived. I took a sip of the Coke. Tim‚Äôs milkshake looked delicious; he drank almost half of it straight down. The mom didn‚Äôt drink at all. She was quiet but relaxed. I didn‚Äôt know if I needed to speak to her or what; so far I‚Äôve talked more with the kid than with her.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúSo, Jimmy! What do you guys do for fun?‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúOh! We don‚Äôt really; we mostly do chores and homework,‚Äù answered the kid in a small, wistful voice.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúBummer. So what do you really do for fun, Elena?‚Äù The burgers arrived. She took a fry and passed one to little Jim, then a cheesy finger, and took a sip of the lemonade. She made up her mind.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really fun, but I like reading.‚Äù I was glad; finally something to talk about.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúOh, tell me more,‚Äù I said and took a bite of the burger.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs a convenient hobby when you‚Äôre between several things at once. I find the time to clear my head and relax for a couple of pages,‚Äù she took another sip of the lemonade. ‚ÄúThen Jim calls me, or the laundry is ready, it‚Äôs dinner time, or someone is ringing. Then I just stop, put the book down, do what I have to do, and pick it up again right where I left off.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like freezing time,‚Äù I said and took another bite of the burger.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ kind of, I think.‚Äù We went quiet for a second, then all took a bite of our burgers.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúHey, Jimmy! Can I try your shake?‚Äù He nodded. I took a fry and chopped it in the shake.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúWhat are you doing!?‚Äù said Jimmy, laughing incredulously.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúC‚Äômon, you haven‚Äôt tried this?‚Äù I said, looking at both of them.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúMy parents don‚Äôt let me play with the food.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really playing; it‚Äôs just having fun and trying new things. Haven‚Äôt you seen Ratatouille?‚Äù He shook his head.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúMan, what are they teaching kids these days?‚Äù Jim chopped a fry in the shake. The mother didn‚Äôt seem bothered.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúTry it, Mommy; it‚Äôs good!‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúCome on! Try new things like he says,‚Äù the kid pointed at me.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúYeah! It can‚Äôt taste worse than your day earlier,‚Äù I said to her. She smiled more and almost let a laugh out.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúYou are all right, little fella. You are all right!‚Äù I said, smiling to Jimmy.</p>
          <p>We finished our burgers and left for the movie theater. I knew right then I was ready to be a father.</p>
